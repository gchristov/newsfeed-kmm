/*
Since this is a module to build an umbrella framework for the native clients, it doesn't really need
any specific code yet. However, without any code the embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode Gradle task
doesn't produce an Xcode framework so this is why this file exists.

// TODO: Will this always be needed? Can the framework still be generated even without any classes?
